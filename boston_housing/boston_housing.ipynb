    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",

    "The score of the training curve decreased when more training points are added. And the score of the testing curve increases as more points are added. As more data is introduced, the testing curve starts to perform badly after a point. Based on the graph, the training curve stabilizes after 300 training samples. This indicates, provided that the data is randomized, the model is not learning new patterns from the data and adding more data doesn't improve the model. On the other hand, the testing curve starts to diverge after apparoximately 330 samples. This occurs because max_depth at 6, the model is overfitting the data and testing starts to perform worse."

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Model suffers from high bias when it is trained with a maximum depth of 1. The model is not complex enough to perform well with the data set it is working with due to its simplicity and both training and validation perform badly. When the maximum depth is at 10, the model starts to memorize the data and overfit. This is clearly indicated by the diverging training and validation curves. While the training score is high, the model responds with low validation scores because it struggles to perfom well with unseen data.   "

    "### Question 6 - Best-Guess Optimal Model\n",
    "* Which maximum depth do you think results in a model that best generalizes to unseen data? \n",
    "* What intuition lead you to this answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

    "When a certain learning algorithm is being used to solve a machine learning problem, which values to use as algorithm's parameters to obtain the best model for the data needs to be determined (parameter tuning). One approach to tuning the parameters is to train the same algorithm with different parameters on the data set and find the parameters that work best with the data. A standard metric, like F1 score, needs to be used to evaluate the performance of each model against the data set, so that, the parameters of the model with the best score can be selected as the ones that performs best with the data. \n",

    "To select a learning algorithm for a machine learning problem, algorithm's performance on unseen data needs to be evaluated. This can be done with partitioning the data set into a train and a test set. However, there is a possiblity the model will be tuned to perform well with the testing set causing a testing set knowledge 'leak' into the model. A cross validation is a technique that is used to eliminate this issue without disrupting the quantity of data that is available for training. In k-fold cross-validation, the training data set is randomely devided into 'k' number of smaller data sets and k-1 sets are used to train the algorithm while the remaining data set is used to measure the effectiveness of the data (using a score like F1), the same process is repeated k times, each iteration using a validation set that was not used before. Finally, the evaluation metric's value for each iteration is analyzed, for example, with mean and standard deviation, to determine how performant the model is.\n",

In grid search, a model with a unique set of parameter values will go through a k-fold cross validation step for learning and validating a model which would eliminate a model reporting higher evaluation metrics due to the model overfitting the data."

Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*.

The three features,average number of rooms in the neighborhood, average level of income of the people in the neighborhood and the student to teacher ratio, that are used to build the model are related to attributes in the neighborhood. While these features are relevant, there are other important attributes that are directly related to a home price like the square footage, the number of rooms in the house, number of bathrooms and age of the house. If the model could have incorporated such features with the three features that were already used, the usability of the model in a real-world setting would have increased by a great degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corelation of the three features to home prices are still valid. For instance, just as in 1978, a home in a high income neighborhood would still be priced more than a home in a low income neighborhood. Also, it can be argued, the correlation of the three features to homes in a rurla city is similar. However, the absolute values of the houses have changed over a period of 40 years and also change depending on the location. The prices need to be adjusted for inflation and corrected based on the location to be used in a real-world setting.\n",
